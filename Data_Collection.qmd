> The following methods were performed for collecting data during the statewide study (similar methods were performed for each pilot study). Each campus' Institutional Review Board (IRB) was contacted, and each IRB office determined what materials were needed to approve of the research (either entering a reliance agreement with Chico State, applying to their own IRB application, or nothing will be needed). In order to ensure students were in the EOP/EOPS, EOP/EOPS staff were contacted and asked to provide us with a list of their EOP/EOPS students' names and emails, which was also used to send the students their \$25 gift card incentive upon completing the survey. In past pilots, students have sent the survey link to their friends who may not be part of the EOP/EOPS, may not be eligible for basic needs services, and/or are less likely to have used them. Using a list of EOP/EOPS students' names/emails for an eligibility check was implemented to help recruit our target population.

> A link to an interest form (using Google Forms) was emailed by the EOP/EOPS staff to their students. This form determined if students met the previously mentioned eligibility criteria and consent to participate in the research. An R script was used to compare emails entered into the interest form to emails in the EOP/EOPS list (sent by the EOP/EOPS staff) to ensure students are in the EOP/EOPS. Eligible students were then emailed a Qualtrics survey link, where they had a month to complete the survey after starting the survey. Reminder emails were sent periodically to increase participation rate. Students who completed the survey are then sent a \$25 gift card. An outline of the procedures can be seen below.
