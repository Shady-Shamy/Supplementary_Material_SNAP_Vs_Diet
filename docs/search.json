    "text": "Significant associations were found between the campus type (CSU, UC, and CCC) and dependent variables at the bivariate level. However, after controlling for other covariates, there were no more significant associations. Due to the Pilot 2 cohort not including any UC or CCC campuses, both cohort and campus type could not be included as covariates. Because significant associations were found between cohort and fast food intake as well as cohort and SSB intake after controlling for covariates, cohort was included in the final models over campus type. All other associations stay the same regardless of the variable used.\n\n\nFast Food Vs Campus Type Bivariate Analysis\n\n\nShow the code\nchisq.test(bns_combined_imputed_df$ff_cat,

    "text": "The following methods were performed for collecting data during the statewide study (similar methods were performed for the second pilot study). Each campus’ Institutional Review Board (IRB) was contacted, and each IRB office determined what materials were needed to approve of the research (either entering a reliance agreement with Chico State, applying to their own IRB application, or nothing will be needed). In order to ensure students were in the EOP/EOPS, EOP/EOPS staff were contacted and asked to provide us with a list of their EOP/EOPS students’ names and emails, which were also used to send the students their $25 gift card incentive upon completing the survey. In past pilots, students have sent the survey link to their friends who may not be part of the EOP/EOPS, may not be eligible for basic needs services, and/or are less likely to have used them. Using a list of EOP/EOPS students’ names/emails for an eligibility check was implemented to help recruit our target population.\n\n\nA link to an interest form (using Google Forms) was emailed by the EOP/EOPS staff to their students. This form determined if students met eligibility criteria and consent to participate in the research. An R script was used to compare emails entered into the interest form to emails in the EOP/EOPS list (sent by the EOP/EOPS staff) to ensure students are in the EOP/EOPS. Eligible students were then emailed a Qualtrics survey link, where they had a month to complete the survey after starting the survey. Reminder emails were sent periodically to increase participation rate. Students who completed the survey are then sent a $25 gift card. An outline of the procedures can be seen below."

Students appeared to be confused between race and ethnicity as there were many students who identified as Hispanic in the ethnicity question and then proceeded to choose “Prefer not to answer” in the race question. Race and ethnicity were coded as the following 5 categories: Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Asian (having only selected one Asian race), and Other (including two or more races, Hispanic Blacks, Hispanic Asians, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and unknown race or ethnicity).\n\n\nThose who chose “Gender Queer or Gender-Nonconforming,” “Gender non-binary,” and “Gender Unlisted” were dropped from the analysis. Those who chose “Prefer not to answer” were kept in the data set and imputed (n = 19).\n\n\nAge was rounded down to the nearest whole number. Paid work hours, unpaid work hours, and caregiving hours were divided by 10 and units were divided by 4 to better interpret the results.\n\n\nCooking confidence was surveyed on a 5-point Likert scale asking “How confident are you that you can use basic cooking skills, like cutting vegetables, fruits and measuring out ingredients, or following a recipe?” Those who responded “Not at all confident”, “Not very confident”, or “Neutral” were coded as “No” (not confident). Those who chose “Somewhat confident” or “Very Confident” were coded as “Yes” (confident).\n\n\nHealth consciousness was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale stating “I do not think about my eating/food habits.” Those who chose “Strongly disagree”, or “Disagree” were coded as “Yes” (regularly thinks about eating). Those who chose “Neither agree nor disagree”, “Agree”, or “Strongly agree” were coded as “No” (doesn’t regularly think about eating).\n\n\nKitchen access was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale stating “I do not regularly have access to a kitchen where I can prepare meals.” Those who chose “Strongly disagree”, or “Disagree” were coded as “Yes” (has kitchen access). Those who chose “Neither agree nor disagree”, “Agree”, or “Strongly agree” were coded as “No” (doesn’t have kitchen access).\n\n\nAdequate storage room was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale stating “I do not have enough room to store food items.” Those who chose “Strongly disagree”, or “Disagree” were coded as “Yes” (has adequate storage room). Those who chose “Neither agree nor disagree”, “Agree”, or “Strongly agree” were coded as “No” (doesn’t have adequate storage room).\n\n\nAdequate storage access was assessed on a 5-point Likert scale stating “I have a secure place to store fresh food and pantry items.” Those who chose “Strongly Agree”, or “Agree” were coded as “Yes” (has adequate storage access). Those who chose “Neither agree nor disagree”, “Disagree”, or “Strongly disagree” were coded as “No” (doesn’t have adequate storage access).\n\n\nLiving arrangements were asked as a multiple-choice question with 13 options. Those who responded, “I live with parents or other relatives, paying rent with my own money or”I live with parents or other relatives, not paying rent with my own money” were coded as “Yes” (living with parents). All other non-missing options were coded as “No” (not living with parents).\n\n\nHomelessness in the past year was determined using a series of eight questions. Anyone who responded as living in any one of these locations in the past year and/or month were classified as homeless in the past year: “At a shelter”, “Temporarily living with a relative, friend, or couch surfing until I find other housing,” “Temporarily at a hotel or motel without a permanent home to return to (not on vacation or business travel)”, “In a transitional housing or independent living program”, “At a group home such as a halfway house or residential program for mental health or substance abuse,” “Outdoor location such as street, sidewalk, alley, park, etc.,” “In a car, truck, van, RV or camper,” and “In a closed area/space with a roof not meant for human habituation such as an abandoned building, garage, tent, etc.”\n\n\nHousing insecurity was determined based on a series of eight questions. Anyone who answered “Yes” to at least three of these questions were classified as housing insecure: 1) “In the past 12 months, was there a rent or mortgage increase that made it difficult to pay?” 2) “In the past 12 months, have you been unable to pay or underpaid your rent or mortgage?” 3) “In the past 12 months, have you ever been late paying rent or mortgage?” 4) “In the past 12 months, have you been unable to pay or underpaid a utility bill?” 5) “In the past 12 months, have you lived with others beyond the expected capacity of your house or apartment?” 6) “In the past 12 months, have you been asked to leave your home by someone you lived with?” 7) “In the past 12 months, have you been evicted?” and 8) “In the past 12 months, have you had to stay in a hostile housing environment or abusive relationship because you had no other place to live?” Cases with missing values without three “Yes” responses and without six “No” responses were set to missing. For example, someone who responded with six “No” responses and had two missing values will make it impossible to have three “Yes” responses and this person will be marked as “No” (not housing insecure). While someone with two “Yes” responses and one or more missing responses will be marked as missing in the housing insecurity variable since they can possibly still be housing insecure.\n\n\nFood insecurity was measured using the 2-item food security assessment which asks: “Within the past 12 months we worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more” and “Within the past 12 months the food we bought just didn’t last and we didn’t have money to get more.” Anyone who answered “often true” or “sometimes true” to both questions is deemed food insecure.\n\n\nPhysical activity was surveyed in three separate questions asking how many days per week a student engages in moderate exercise, strength training exercise, and vigorous exercise. Students who engaged in any of the three forms of exercise for at least one day per week were coded as “Yes” (engages in physical activity). Students who responded zero days per week in all three questions were coded as “No” (does not engage in physical activity).\n\n\nPaid work hours, unpaid work hours, and caregiving hours were all divided by 10 to give a more interpretable odds ratio. Similarly, enrolled units were divided by 4.\n\n\nSNAP eligibility was determined based on the following criteria for students as documented by the California Department of Social Services (CDSS): the student must be between the ages 18 and 49; must be a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident; must be enrolled in at least half-time units (6 units); must receive less than 11 meals per week from other sources; must meet income and household requirements; and must meet at least one work exemption. At the time of the start of the statewide survey, being in the EOP/EOPS exempted students from having to meet a work requirement. Therefore, an assumption that being in the EOP/EOPS will satisfy the work requirement is made when determining SNAP eligibility status in the current study. However, it should be noted that as of September 2022, being in the EOP/EOPS is no longer an exemption unless the school has applied for their program to be part of the Local Programs that Increases Employability. Additionally, if a person is older than 49 and/or is enrolled in less than six units, the CDSS does not classify that person as a student, and that person only needs to meet the income/household and citizenship requirements to be eligible for SNAP.\n\n\nSNAP status was created using five questions, whether they are currently using SNAP, household size, monthly household income, U.S. citizenship, and lawful permanent residency if not a U.S. citizen. Those that reported currently using SNAP were coded as “SNAP Recipients”. Those that met the SNAP eligibility criteria and did not receive SNAP benefits were coded as “Likely Eligible Non-Recipient.” Those that did not meet SNAP eligibility criteria and did not receive SNAP benefits were coded as “Income-Ineligible Non-Recipient.”\n\n\nFast food intake responses were recorded in the following ranges “Zero times per week,” “1-2 times per week,” “3-4 times per week,” “5-6 times per week,” “7-8 times per week,” “9-10 times per week,” and “11 or more times per week.” Due to low responses in the higher frequency groups, students who responded “5-6 times per week” and above were combined into a “5 or more times per week” group to improve model fit.\n\n\nDaily SSB intake responses were recorded in the following ranges: “Zero ounces,” “1-8 ounces,” “9-16 ounces,” “17-24 ounces,” “25-36 ounces,” “37-48 ounces,” “49-56 ounces,” “57-64 ounces,” and “64 ounces or more ounces.” Due to low responses in the higher intake groups, students with responses above 17 ounces were combined into a “17 or more ounces” group to improve model fit.\n\n\nF&V intake responses were recorded in the following ranges: “Zero servings per day,” “1-2 servings per day,” “3-4 servings per day,” and “5 or more servings per day.” Due to a low number of students responding “5 or more servings per day,” this level was combined into a “3 or more servings per day” group to improve the fit of the regression models.\n\n\n\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(error = FALSE,warning = FALSE,message = FALSE,echo = TRUE)\n\nbns &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"/Users/shady/Box/CHC All/10.

    "text": "This site serves as a reference to all code and supplementary material used for the SNAP vs College Students’ Diet Quality Manuscript. Below is the abstract of the paper:\n\n\nCollege students in the United States have low quality diets consisting of frequent fast food intake, high sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, and low fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake. Having a low income is one of the most prominent predictors of a low-quality diet. Many low-income students are likely eligible to participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), however, only an estimated 18% of likely eligible students in California are participating. This study analyzes the associations between SNAP use and fast food, SSB, and F&V intake among California college students.\n\n\nSelf-reported data was collected using a cross-sectional study design. Three ordinal regression models were built with the dietary intake indicators as the dependent variables, SNAP status as the independent variable, and relevant covariates. SNAP status was divided into three groups: those that were currently using SNAP, those that were likely eligible non-recipients (LENRs), and those that were income-ineligible non-recipients (IINRs).\n\n\nAfter controlling for covariates, LENRs were more likely to consume fast food (OR: 1.67, 95% CI: 1.35 - 2.07, p &lt; 0.001), and SSBs (OR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.09 – 1.65, p = 0.006) and were less likely to consume F&Vs (OR: 0.55, 95% CI: 0.44 – 0.68, p &lt; 0.001) compared to SNAP recipients. IINRs were also more likely to consume fast food (OR: 2.05, 95% CI: 1.44 - 2.92, p &lt; 0.001), and SSBs (OR: 1.44, 95% CI: 1.06 – 1.95, p = 0.020) and were less likely to consume F&Vs (OR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.45 – 0.97, p = 0.033) compared to SNAP recipients.\n\n\nAlthough there were positive dietary associations with receiving SNAP benefits, an alarming number of students were still not eating enough F&Vs in all three groups, and more than half of the students consumed at least one serving of SSBs daily and one to two meals of fast food a week. Future research should investigate the efficacy of nutrition education, nutrition incentive programs, and SNAP participation in coordination with one another for improving college students’ diets."

Potentially relevant variables from the survey were identified based on a theoretical approach and previous qualitative studies among college students. A LASSO regression was first used to identify which variables are relevant to each model. A ten-fold cross validation was used to determine the minimum lambda value (the optimum level of regularization). General linear regression models were then fit for each dependent variable including all potential covariates using the optimum level of regularization. Academic level was not included as a potential covariate since the pilot 2 cohort included no freshmen and sophomores."
