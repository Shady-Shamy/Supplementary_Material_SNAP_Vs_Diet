    "text": "Significant associations were found between the campus type (CSU, UC, and CCC) and dependent variables at the bivariate level. However, after controlling for other covariates, there were no more significant associations. Due to the Pilot 2 cohort not including any UC or CCC campuses, both cohort and campus type could not be included as covariates. Because significant associations were found between cohort and fast food intake as well as cohort and SSB intake after controlling for covariates, cohort was included in the final models over campus type. All other associations stay the same regardless of the variable used.\n\n\nFast Food Vs Campus Type Bivariate Analysis\n\n\nShow the code\nchisq.test(bns_combined_imputed_df$ff_cat,

    "text": "The following methods were performed for collecting data during the statewide study (similar methods were performed for each pilot study). Each campus’ Institutional Review Board (IRB) was contacted, and each IRB office determined what materials were needed to approve of the research (either entering a reliance agreement with Chico State, applying to their own IRB application, or nothing will be needed). In order to ensure students were in the EOP/EOPS, EOP/EOPS staff were contacted and asked to provide us with a list of their EOP/EOPS students’ names and emails, which was also used to send the students their $25 gift card incentive upon completing the survey. In past pilots, students have sent the survey link to their friends who may not be part of the EOP/EOPS, may not be eligible for basic needs services, and/or are less likely to have used them. Using a list of EOP/EOPS students’ names/emails for an eligibility check was implemented to help recruit our target population.\n\n\nA link to an interest form (using Google Forms) was emailed by the EOP/EOPS staff to their students. This form determined if students met the previously mentioned eligibility criteria and consent to participate in the research. An R script was used to compare emails entered into the interest form to emails in the EOP/EOPS list (sent by the EOP/EOPS staff) to ensure students are in the EOP/EOPS. Eligible students were then emailed a Qualtrics survey link, where they had a month to complete the survey after starting the survey. Reminder emails were sent periodically to increase participation rate. Students who completed the survey are then sent a $25 gift card. An outline of the procedures can be seen below."

Race and ethnicity were asked using the US census tool where students were first asked about their ethnicity in a single-selection multiple choice question and then their race in a select all that apply question. Students appeared to be confused between race and ethnicity as there were many students who identified as Hispanic in the ethnicity question and then proceeded to choose “Prefer not to answer” in the race question. Race and ethnicity were coded as the following 5 categories: Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, Non-Hispanic Asian (having only selected one Asian race), and Other (including two or more races, Hispanic Blacks, Hispanic Asians, American Indian or Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and unknown race or ethnicity).\n\n\nCooking confidence was surveyed on a 5-point Likert scale where those who responded “Not at all confident”, “Not very confident”, or “Neutral” were coded as “No” (Not confident). Those who chose “Somewhat confident” or “Very Confident” were coded as “Yes” (Confident).\n\n\nLiving arrangements were asked as a multiple-choice question with 13 options. Those who responded, “I live with parents or other relatives, paying rent with my own money or”I live with parents or other relatives, not paying rent with my own money” were coded as “Yes” (living with parents). All other non-missing options were coded as “No” (Not living with parents).\n\n\nHomelessness in the past year was determined using a series of eight questions. Anyone who responded as living in any one of these locations in the past year and/or month were classified as homeless in the past year: “At a shelter”, “Temporarily living with a relative, friend, or couch surfing until I find other housing,” “Temporarily at a hotel or motel without a permanent home to return to (not on vacation or business travel)”, “In a transitional housing or independent living program”, “At a group home such as a halfway house or residential program for mental health or substance abuse,” “Outdoor location such as street, sidewalk, alley, park, etc.,” “In a car, truck, van, RV or camper,” and “In a closed area/space with a roof not meant for human habituation such as an abandoned building, garage, tent, etc.”\n\n\nHousing insecurity was determined based on a series of eight questions. Anyone who answered “Yes” to at least three of these questions were classified as housing insecure: 1) “In the past 12 months, was there a rent or mortgage increase that made it difficult to pay?” 2) “In the past 12 months, have you been unable to pay or underpaid your rent or mortgage?” 3) “In the past 12 months, have you ever been late paying rent or mortgage?” 4) “In the past 12 months, have you been unable to pay or underpaid a utility bill?” 5) “In the past 12 months, have you lived with others beyond the expected capacity of your house or apartment?” 6) “In the past 12 months, have you been asked to leave your home by someone you lived with?” 7) “In the past 12 months, have you been evicted?” and 8) “In the past 12 months, have you had to stay in a hostile housing environment or abusive relationship because you had no other place to live?” Cases with missing values without six “Yes” responses and without six “No” responses were set to missing. For example, someone who responded with six “No” responses and had two missing values will make it impossible to have three “Yes” responses and this person will be marked as “No” (not housing insecure). While someone with two “Yes” responses and one or more missing responses will be marked as missing in the housing insecurity variable since they can possibly still be housing insecure.\n\n\nFood insecurity was measured using the 2-item food security assessment which asks: “Within the past 12 months we worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more” and “Within the past 12 months the food we bought just didn’t last and we didn’t have money to get more.” Anyone who answered “often true” or “sometimes true” to both questions is deemed food insecure.\n\n\nHealth consciousness was asked on a 5-point Likert scale. Those who chose “Strongly disagree”, or “Disagree” were coded as “Yes” (Regularly think about eating). Those who chose “Neither agree nor disagree”, “Agree”, or “Strongly agree” were coded as “No” (Doesn’t regularly think about eating).\n\n\nKitchen access was asked on a 5-point Likert scale. Those who chose “Strongly disagree”, or “Disagree” were coded as “Yes” (Has kitchen access). Those who chose “Neither agree nor disagree”, “Agree”, or “Strongly agree” were coded as “No” (Doesn’t have kitchen access).\n\n\nAdequate storage room was asked on a 5-point Likert scale. Those who chose “Strongly disagree”, or “Disagree” were coded as “Yes” (Has adequate storage room). Those who chose “Neither agree nor disagree”, “Agree”, or “Strongly agree” were coded as “No” (Doesn’t have adequate storage room).\n\n\nMonthly household income was asked in ranges based on SNAP eligibility income requirements at the time of the surveys. The income ranges slightly differed between the Statewide data and the Pilot 2 data and were collapsed into five levels. Those who chose “Less than $150” or “$150 or less” was coded as “Very Low”; “$151-$2,148” or “$151-$2,082” were coded as “Low”; “$2,149-$2,904” or “$2,083-$2,820” were coded as “Moderate”; “$2,905-$3,660” or “$2,821-$3,556” were coded as “High”; and all other responses greater than $3,661 (in the statewide data set) or $3,557 (in the pilot 2 data set) were coded as “Very High.”\n\n\nPhysical activity was surveyed in three separate questions asking how many days per week a student engages in moderate exercise, strength training exercise, and vigorous exercise. Students who engaged in any of the three forms of exercise for at least one day per week were coded as “Yes” (engages in physical activity). Students who responded zero days per week in all three questions were coded as “No” (does not engage in physical activity).\n\n\nThose who chose “Gender Queer or Gender-Nonconforming,” “Gender non-binary,” and “Gender Unlisted” were dropped from the analysis. Those who chose “Prefer not to answer” were kept in the data set and imputed.\n\n\nSNAP status was created using five questions, whether they are currently using SNAP, household size, monthly household income, U.S. citizenship, and lawful permanent residency if not a U.S. citizen. Those that reported currently using SNAP were coded as “SNAP”. Those that met the SNAP eligibility criteria discussed in the methods sections and did not receive SNAP benefits were coded as “No SNAP but likely eligible.” Those that did not meet SNAP eligibility criteria and did not receive SNAP benefits were coded as “No SNAP and likely ineligible.”\n\n\nAge was rounded down to the nearest whole number. Paid work hours, unpaid work hours, and caregiving hours were divided by 10 and units were divided by 4 to better interpret the results.\n\n\n\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(error = FALSE,warning = FALSE,message = FALSE,echo = TRUE)\n\nbns &lt;- readRDS(here::here(\"/Users/shady/Box/CHC All/10.

All potential covariates were included in the imputation process as well as variables used to create the derived variables. Some of the variables that were used to create the dependent variables were removed due to too much collinearity with the derived variable and issues with reaching convergence. Some data management was performed to dichotomize variables, change reference values, and create variables used for testing different models. Models using imputed data were compared to models using complete case data."

    "text": "This site serves as a reference to all code and supplementary material used for the CalFresh Vs College Students’ Diet Quality Manuscript. Below is the abstract of the paper:\n\n\nCollege students in the United States have low quality diets consisting of frequent fast food intake, high sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) intake, and low fruit and vegetable (F&V) intake. Having a low income is one of the most prominent predictors of a low-quality diet. Many low-income students are likely eligible to participate in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), however, only an estimated 18% of likely eligible students in California are participating. This study analyzes the associations between SNAP use and fast food, SSB, and F&V intake among California college students.\n\n\nSelf-reported data was collected using a cross-sectional study design. Three ordinal regression models were built with the dietary intake indicators as the dependent variables, SNAP status as the independent variable, and relevant covariates. SNAP status was divided into three groups: those that were currently using SNAP, those that were likely eligible non-recipients (LENRs), and those that were income-ineligible non-recipients (IINRs).\n\n\nAfter controlling for covariates, LENRs were more likely to consume fast food (OR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.33 - 2.15, p &lt; 0.001), and SSBs (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.12 – 1.66, p = 0.002) and were less likely to consume F&Vs (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.45 – 0.72, p &lt; 0.001) compared to SNAP recipients. IINRs were also more likely to consume fast food (OR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.43 - 2.45, p &lt; 0.001), and SSBs (OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.17 – 2.01, p = 0.003) and were less likely to consume F&Vs (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.38 – 0.84, p = 0.007) compared to SNAP recipients.\n\n\nAlthough there were positive dietary associations with receiving SNAP benefits, an alarming number of students were still not eating enough F&Vs in all three groups, and more than half of the students consumed at least one serving of SSBs daily and one to two meals of fast food a week. Future research should investigate the efficacy of nutrition education, nutrition incentive programs, and SNAP participation in coordination with one another for improving college students’ diets."

    "text": "This page shows all procedures used to choose the best fitting model. The BIC and AIC of a Poisson, linear, log transformation, and an ordinal regression model were compared. The ordinal regression models fit the best and had the lowest AICs and BICs. To ensure that there were no major differences in results across the different levels of the dependent variables, stratified logistic regressions were fitted and compared. All results appeared to stay consistent across the different levels, justifying the use of an ordinal regression model."
