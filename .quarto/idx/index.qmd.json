Having a low income is one of the most prominent predictors of a low-quality diet, causing difficulties for low-income students to maintain a healthy diet in addition to the many other barriers to healthy eating that students face.

Three ordinal regression models were built with the dietary intake indicators as the dependent variables, SNAP status as the independent variable, and relevant covariates.
